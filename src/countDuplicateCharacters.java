     * This file counts the duplicate characters in a string
     * 
     * It iterates through the characters in the string and stores each character in
     * a map where the character is the key with an integer value representing the
     * count.
     * 
     * if the character doesn't exist in the map, then it is added to the map with
     * an integer value of 1
     * 
     * if the character already exists, then the value is incremented by 1
